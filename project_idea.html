            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I will be creating a mobile app that forces the user to live healthier. This app is useful for users who want to live a healthy life but lack of motivations and self discipline. By agreeing to download the app, the user authorises the app to limit the usage of phone and the user must cooperate by entering their daily routines in a honest behaviour. The app includes controlling the screen time usage of the user, the daily calories the user consumes, the amount the water the user consumes, the amount of exercises the user does, and sleeping quality and time of the user. Beyond that, the app also notifies the user with daily weather reports and their daily agendas so the user can use it as a useful tool.
            </p>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>I want to design such mobile app is due to my personal experience. For me, I sleep irregularly, consume too much junk food like fried chickens, drink few water but much sweets, never exercises, and staring at social medias on iPhone for more than 12 hours daily. This has also happened to many of my friends and family. I see this as a common problem for many people in the cities in the 21st century. It is crucial to human’s health and well-being for people to live longer, happier, and to enjoy a healthier lifestyle when people get old. I want to program an app like this so human communities can be more wholesome. 
            </p>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Before the user starts using the app, the user is required to agree to not lie and to follow to app notifications and reminders otherwise the app is useless. First and foremost, the user will allow the app to monitor and control the screen time usage. It will limit the user to look at their screen for no longer than 8 hours on default. The user then must enter their daily food and water intake by entering exact food name and amount of water. The app will automatically calculate the calories of the food and limits the intake of calories based on the user’s BMI based on the user’s height and weight. On the aspect of water, the app reminds the user to drink about 100 ml of water every 1 hour. If the user consumes anything that the app considers unhealthy, such as deep fried food, bubble tea, or unnecessary spices, the user’s screen time allowance shall be deducted by 30 minutes for each item. Nonetheless, the users are welcome to enter a period of time of the day that they wish to exercise. During that specific period of time, the app will automatically reminds the users to exercise and will not be able to use the phone to play games, watch videos, or other entertainments until the exercise session is done. Furthermore, the user shall enter an ideal sleeping hours according to each persona’s different habits of sleeping, so the app can reminds the users to go to bed by that time. When the user is reminded to go to bed, the app turns on “Do Not Disturb” by default 15 minutes after the reminder. During that 15 minutes of time, the app plays a calm background music while the user have a little more time to set up and prepare agendas for the next day. Other really useful features including weather reports and agenda or “to do list” reminder. After the app wakes up the user with a refreshing morning background music, the daily weather report feature notifies the user with latest weather reports including highest temperature of the day, lowest temperature of the day, percentage of rainfall, and other daily weather phenomenons. The agenda reminder feature allows the user to enter their “next day” agenda and the app will automatically notifies and reminds the user not to forget to do before the user starts the day. These are basic essence that a human needs to be more healthy in the 21st century, and this app is for everybody to live a longer and healthier life.</p>
            <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>In order to create the mobile, I will need to use a personal computer to user mobile programming editors such as Dcoder, Xcode, or Android Web Developer, the runner or launcher that I can run the codes with. I will also need a mobile phone such as an iPhone or an android to test the results in order to design better and better versions from my personal experience of use.
            </p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>This mobile app clearly requires me and my team to code by using programming languages such as JAVA, Python, C++, PHP, and may more. I am now learning Python and hopefully will have time to learn other languages so I can choose the best programming language to use. These writing skills are very feasible since the programming languages can be learnt by oneself online. Of course when we are working on this project as a team, we will be using GitHb for collaboration of works and modifications of app.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The original motivation to design this app was driven by the lack of self-discipline of people who want to get healthy. When this app is fully designed and run, the users of the app should be able to live a scheduled daily life with the app’s help. Hopefully we can publish this app onto App Store for iPhones or Google Play for androids, so the useful personal health assistant app can benefit more and more people around the world and solving the problems of unhealthy lifestyles.</p>
