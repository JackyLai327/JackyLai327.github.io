            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>I am Yu-Cheng (Jacky) Lai from <strong>Taiwan</strong>. I was born on 27th March, 2000 in Taipei. I’m now a student of <strong>Bachelor of Information Technology</strong> at RMIT. I like to make friends and get involved in teamwork events. To me, good music and delicious food is very important in terms of leisure time.  I can speak Mandarin, English, Thai and a bit of Spanish. One of my greatest strengths is when I find something interesting that I like, I get really devoted in it, and I can learn and adapt new things really quickly. Nevertheless, challenges are also really crucial in my life. <strong>“When life gives you a lemon, you make it lemonade.”</strong>

            <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
            <p>In so many fields of Information Technology, I like <strong>programming, computing, and data administration</strong> the most. Before I found my interest in IT, I used to want to be a musician and studied music at the University of Sydney. One day my friend who studies at RMIT told me about Information Technology and I fell for it since I got the Math Department Award in high school, and I also love making big money. I then researched so many other universities in Australia, and due to the fame of RMIT in IT industries and the cooperations with big companies like Google, RMIT became my first choice on the list. During the journey of RMIT, I am looking forward to <strong>programming</strong> in so many different languages and <strong>practical computing</strong>. Since I had never learned any coding or computing in high school, I’m pretty new to the IT world. However, I will surely work hard enough to catch up with other people at my age.
