                <p>These Google positions are many IT and CS students’ dream jobs I believe. Most of them require many years of engineering or CS related experiences and a lot of achievements, work portfolios, or competitions. From the list, <strong>Program Manager</strong> would be my dream.

                <h2>Requirements of this Job</h2>
                <p>According to Google’s offical website, this position requires a <strong>Bachelor’s degree</strong>, <strong>7 years of CS related experience</strong> as well as <strong>project management experience</strong>, and the ability to work in <strong>teams</strong> effectively and <strong>analyse</strong>. This job takes a lot of responsibility, but also, a <strong>high wage</strong>, which is what appeals me. </p>

                <p>As for now, I barely have the experiences and skills they require except for <strong>HTML, CSS, and a bit of python</strong>.</p>

                <h2>Plan</h2>
                <p>In my plan, I will learn programming languages in class and on my own time, participate in multiple <strong>hackathons</strong> and create many <strong>projects/work</strong> before I graduate. At the mean time, it is necessary to apply for <strong>internship at Google</strong>. Once I am enough to get into Google, it is no joke. Stepping up as an intern will require much more effort than in college and I shall not give up at this point, not until I get my dream job title. Of course I’ll have to learn and work harder for that high position and I’m positive that <strong>I will grind hard</strong> to get that job title.</p>
